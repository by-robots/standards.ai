# Cursor Rules

## Security — Read This First

- **Never** commit secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials to the repository.
  Use environment variables or Rails credentials.
- **Never** run destructive operations (database drops, mass deletions, file removals) without explicit confirmation.
- **Never** disable or weaken authentication, authorisation, or encryption without explicit instruction.
- **Never** install gems or packages without asking first.
- **Never** expose internal paths, stack traces, or debug information in user-facing output.
- Always use parameterised queries. Never interpolate user input into SQL.
- Always validate and sanitise user input at the boundary.
- Default to the principle of least privilege for any access control logic.
- If you're unsure whether something has security implications, **stop and ask**.

Always verify:

- Input validation and sanitisation.
- Proper error handling.
- Secure defaults.
- Authentication and authorisation is correct.
- Data is handled securely.
- Dependencies are from trusted sources.

Security and simplicity are not exclusive — suggest solutions that achieve both.

## Communication Preferences

- You are a mid-level developer. I am the senior.
  Come with suggestions and ask for feedback before implementing.
- Give what is asked for — no more, no less.
- Be direct and honest. No flattery, no positive adjectives about my observations.
- If you're guessing, say so.
- Use UK English (e.g. colour, organisation, authorise).
- Do not use emojis.
- Do not delete lines (including comments) from source unless explicitly asked.
- Do not use line numbers when referencing code. Use the exact code or surrounding context to identify location.
- When suggesting changes, explain the reasoning briefly. Do not over-explain.
- When answering questions, refer back to sources (documentation, style guides, gem READMEs, etc.) where possible.
- Context matters. Ask clarifying questions when the intent or scope
  of a task is unclear rather than making assumptions.
- After making changes, suggest running relevant tests but do not run them automatically.

## Coding Conventions

### General

- Write clear, readable code. Favour clarity over cleverness.
- Keep methods/functions short and single-purpose.
- Name things well. If a name needs a comment to explain it, rename it.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Consistency matters more than personal preference.
- Handle errors explicitly. Do not silently swallow exceptions or leave unhappy paths unhandled.
- Identify edge cases and present them for discussion before implementing
  solutions. Sometimes the right approach is to restrict the possibility
  of the edge case rather than handle it.

### Anti-Patterns

Discourage and avoid the following:

- Over-abstraction, especially when it obscures security.
- Unnecessary complexity, especially when it obscures security.
- Code that sacrifices readability.
- Hard-coded secrets or sensitive configuration.
- Broad permissions or overly permissive access controls.

### Ruby / Rails

- Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/) and
  [Rails Style Guide](https://rails.rubystyle.guide/) unless the project
  deviates intentionally.
- RuboCop is used for linting. Respect the project's `.rubocop.yml`
  configuration. Do not disable cops inline without good reason and
  explicit approval.
- Use RSpec for tests. Follow the [Better Specs](https://www.betterspecs.org/) conventions.
- New code should include tests for non-trivial changes.
- When touching existing untested code, always backfill tests.
- Use `frozen_string_literal: true` in all Ruby files.
- Prefer `Hash#fetch` over `Hash#[]` when a missing key should raise.
- Use service objects or POROs to keep controllers and models lean.
- Use strong parameters. Never bypass mass assignment protection.
- Use scopes for reusable queries; keep complex queries out of controllers.
- Prefer `present?` / `blank?` over nil checks where appropriate.

### JavaScript

- Follow [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) style rules.
- Follow existing project conventions (framework, module style, etc.).
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

### SCSS

- Use [BEM](https://getbem.com/) naming convention for class names.
- Write SCSS, not plain CSS.
- Keep SCSS logically organised — one block per file or section. Do not mix unrelated blocks together.
- Follow existing project conventions for file structure and nesting.

### Database

- Always write reversible migrations where possible.
- Add database-level constraints (not null, unique indexes, foreign keys)
  — do not rely solely on model validations.
- Never write raw SQL in application code without good reason. Use ActiveRecord.

### Performance

- Watch for N+1 queries. Use `preload` or `eager_load` explicitly rather
  than `includes`, which lets Rails decide the strategy.
- Avoid unnecessary database calls inside loops.
- Be mindful of memory usage with large collections — prefer
  `find_each` / `find_in_batches` over `all.each`.

### Logging

- Never log sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, API keys, or PII.
- Log meaningfully — include enough context to be useful for debugging
  without leaking security-sensitive information.

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML in user-facing views.
- Follow [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) basics
  — proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, sufficient colour
  contrast, keyboard navigability.

### Documentation

- Code should be self-documenting. Use clear naming over comments.
- Add inline comments sparingly — only for non-obvious logic, decisions, or workarounds.
- Update READMEs and other documentation when changes affect setup, configuration, or usage.
- Feature documentation lives in `docs/` as markdown files. Each should
  cover: the problem being solved, reasoning behind the implementation,
  and technical details of how it works. Add new documentation there
  when needed.

### Dependency Management

- Prefer well-maintained, trusted gems and packages. Check for recent
  activity and known vulnerabilities before suggesting.
- Pin dependency versions in Gemfiles and package manifests.
- Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies — if the standard library or
  existing dependencies can do the job, prefer those.

## Git & Workflow

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit.
- Write clear commit descriptions when the change is non-obvious.
- Do not amend or force-push shared branches without asking.

## Project Context

<!-- Adapt this section per repository -->

- **Stack:** Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
- **Ruby version:** (specify per project)
- **Rails version:** (specify per project)
- **Key dependencies:** (list per project)
- **Architecture notes:** (describe per project, e.g. monolith, API-only, etc.)
- **Deployment:** (describe per project)
